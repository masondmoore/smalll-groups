        <h1>Highlands Small Groups</h1>
            <p>Small groups have one, simple purpose: to bring people together. We believe God created us to live in relationship with others and only then can we live the full life He intends for us. Sharing life through community is part of our design, but meaningful relationships aren't always easy to find. That's why small groups exist-to make these life-changing relationships relevant and accessible to you.</p>

    <h1>Leading a Small Group</h1>
        <p>Leading a small group isn't about being perfect; it's about serving others by giving them a place to connect. Hosting a group is simple-choose a topic that interests you and select a time and location to meet with others to share it. We give you essential tools to make our small group successful through Leadership Training and a director where you can register your group so others can find it easily.</p>
